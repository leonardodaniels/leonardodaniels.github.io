				<h4>I was born and raised in San Francisco. I attend Saint Ignatius College Preparatory. My extra curriculars consists of playing cross country, soccer, and volleyball, French Club President, a memeber of California Scholarship Federation, a memeber of the Black Student Union, and Association of Latin American Students. Next year, I will be a rising sophomore as the Sophomore Class President. I was accepted into the SMASH Stanford Academy where I am able to further accomplish my goal of becoming a anesthesiologist through networking and building relationships. I am trilingual speaking three languages of English, Spanish, and French. In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends and reading books. A short time goal I would like to achieve is learning how to play the ukulele.  </h4>
